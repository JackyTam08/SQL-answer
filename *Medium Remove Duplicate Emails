Your company has a users table that has accumulated many duplicate email addresses. 
Some of these duplicates are due to differences in case sensitivity, 
while others are due to unintentional whitespaces before or after the email. 
For instance,john@example.com and JOHN@EXAMPLE.COM are considered duplicates.

Write a SQL query that returns records from the users table while excluding any duplicate email entries. Your solution should:

Treat email addresses as duplicates if they match after accounting for case and whitespace
Include only one record for each email, keeping the record with the smallest id.
Return the cleaned table, ordered by id.


SELECT MIN(id) AS id,
TRIM(LOWER(email)) AS cleaned_email              TRIM() - remove all spaces or special cases 
FROM users
GROUP BY cleaned_email
ORDER BY id
